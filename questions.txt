Hi Anupama,
 
This is Virat here from VMware.
 
We would like to take your interview forward. The next round where we would like to see your coding skills with some real world problems.
 
Please go through the questions mentioned below and try to solve them with the best possible solution you think. You will need to send the solution on or before 1-Jan-2018. You can upload it either on Github or send us over Email.
 
If you have any query regarding questions please feel free to reach out to us over the Email (sanjeevk1@vmware.com) in CC.
 
VMWare coding Test (Python)
 
1.            Write a program to reverse a string.
2.            Given two strings S1 and S2. Delete from S2 all those characters which occur in S1 also and finally create a clean S2 with the relevant characters deleted.
3.            Implement a function to delete all instances of a particular item from a linked list.
a.            Briefly describe your design (that is, what is your approach to implementing the logic for this function)
b.            Implement the function in a programming language of your choice
c.            Briefly list down the scenarios that you will test for (in points)
4.            You are given an array with n elements { x1, x2 ... xk ... xn }. You are also given an array location k. Rotate the array such that it contains { xk, xk+1 ... xn, x1, x2 ... xk-1 }. Optimize for space and time as much as you can.
5.            You are given a string, without any duplicate characters. For example: “abcd”. Write a function that takes such a string as input and prints all possible permutations of the string.
